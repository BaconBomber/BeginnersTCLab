You probably don't want a ton of lessons going over every possible example, so the best way to use this knowledge you've learned is figure out when to use these basics. So if you get stuck, review the basics again, even on another python course, and break down big projects into smaller tasks like we talked about in the __Debugging__ lesson. Finish the activity below to complete the basic sections of this python course. "
